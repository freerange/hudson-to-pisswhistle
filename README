This is a simple script that allows Hudson to post build information to another service.

You'll need to install the 'post-build task' plugin, and then set the script to something like this:

    HOST=localhost:5032 STREAM=freerange OAUTH_KEY=MyKey123 hudson-to-pisswhistle &

It's important to remember to run this in the background, because the script needs to wait for the build to finish before build.xml is actually written. That's a pain, but what can you do.
